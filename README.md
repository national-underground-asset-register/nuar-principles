# 15 principles for the successful delivery of data sharing initiatives

## Overview

The Government Digital Service (GDS) team responsible for the delivery of the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR) has spent a great deal of time reflecting on the lessons learnt from all phases of the programme. These are lessons learnt from the things that went well and, more importantly, from the things that did not go well.

We have also learnt a great deal from initiatives around the world that have gone before or run alongside NUAR. We took these lessons and formed them into 15 ‘principles’ for successful delivery, for data sharing programmes especially, but potentially for elements of any digital transformation programme.

We have since shared and tested this with UK stakeholders, members of the delivery supply chain, UK government teams and with international partners and stakeholders from around the world, contributing to a truly global set of principles built upon the learnings and shared experiences of colleagues from around the world.

We are now ready to share these principles more widely. We hope that you may gain some value and insight from them.

The main document provides a summary of the lessons and key learnings, with additional detail for each found in Appendix 1. We hope that they serve as a useful guide for leaders to provide structure to projects and assist with planning. The principles also provide specific learnings and tips for implementers of digital data projects.   

More information about NUAR can be found on **[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-underground-asset-register-nuar)** and the full list of delegations involved in developing these principles can be found in Appendix 2.

## Purpose

While these lessons provide learnings from the development of a specific project, they are applicable to organisations undertaking any manner of digital data projects, particularly targeted at public bodies and public-private supply chains, in the UK and abroad.

They are sequenced in chronological order of commencing a project to the early stages of delivery, comparable to the **[Discovery to Beta of the Service Manual's agile delivery phases](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)**. Living true to the principle of building upon previous work, they are structured into three themes based on the **[Infrastructure and Projects Authority's principles for project success](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f101461e90e070318d2d4cc/IPA_Principles_for_Project_Success.pdf)**: setting up for success, execution and entry into service.
